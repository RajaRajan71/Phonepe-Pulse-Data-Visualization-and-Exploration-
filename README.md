# PHONEPE PULSE DATA VISUALISATION AND EXPLORATION
Phonepe Pulse Data Visualization and Exploration project is used to visualize the data through the dashboard through Streamlit and Plotly. The domain here is FINTECH

## Approaches
1. Data extraction
2. Data transformation
3. Database insertion
4. Dashboard creation
